# Authentication_Web_App

**I developed a full-stack web application 💻 with functionalities for user registration and login.**

👉🏻 Here's the tech stack I used:

🖥 Front-end: **JSP** & **CSS** 

⌨️ Back-end: **Java Servlets**

🗳 Database: **MySQL** with **JDBC**

✨ Key features:

👉🏻 _Secure user registration with database storage (MySQL)_

👉🏻 _User login with error handling_

👉🏻 _Profile page access after successful login_

### NOTE  
This repository contains the JSP, CSS, and Servlet files for a web application. **The folder structure and additional project files necessary for running a J2EE application on a server are not included.**

To run this application, you will need to:

- Create a standard J2EE project structure and copy these files into the appropriate locations.
- Configure a web server to recognize JSP and Servlet files.
